## CONTEXT.py

'''Contextual spellchecker.
   The function as_stream reduces a file to a tokenstream and tests
   to see whether this is a long-s file needing correction. (Ideally
   you should only run it on pre-1830 files that might fall into that
   category.)
   Then the function "catch_ambiguities" can be called for a specific file.
