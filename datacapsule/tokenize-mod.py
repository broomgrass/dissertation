# Overall, the emphasis here is on providing
# a set of normalized features for supervised
# learning. It's definitely not concerned to
# handle English word boundaries in an idiomatic
# way.

# It is also NOT FAST. I use multiprocessing to
# speed it up a little, but more optimization is
# needed. If I find that bigrams don't actually help,
# cutting them out might do a lot to speed things
# up.

        This writes features to file. Importantly, features are written *already normalized*
        by total wordcount, or punctuation count. The reason I do this is that it simplifies
        processing when you're building a model, especially if some of the features are
        statistical metrics that *should not* be divided by total wordcount. If you write
        raw word frequencies, you're going to have to remember later which features get divided
        by total word frequency.

        Special features include:
            #capsprob - the fraction of words capitalized (for any reason, and whether
                          all upper or only titlecased)
            #punctprob - the proportion of tokens that are punctuation marks
            #wordlength - mean length of all alphanumeric tokens
            #fogindex - wordlength * (commas / periods). This is meant to be a rough proxy
                        for wordlength * sentence length. I don't actually calculate
                        sentence length, because it's a pain, but it will leave traces in
                        capsprob, punctprob, and fogindex.
            #bigramcommon - prob a bigram came from list of 5k common bigrams
            #unigramcommon - prob any word came from list of all words in the bigram list
            #seqpredictable - bigramcommon / (unigramcommon ** 2)
                              This roughly reflects conditional entropy. It will be high
                              where words tend to occur in conventional pairings, and low
