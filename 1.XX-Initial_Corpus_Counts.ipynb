    "Following the iterative process of cleaning my data, I had a bibliography of over 4970 short titles, along with their author and publication data. However, a variety of sources contributed to this data, and influenced the numbers. Before we move into searching for files, understanding the constitution of this foundational corpus is important because it influences what works we may find.\n",

    "This notebook calculates and visualizes numbers in my original bibliography. This includes:\n",
    "1. Publication numbers sorted by year\n",
    "2. Publication numbers sorted by source bibliography\n",

    "        b. Common titles (ie, titles that appear in more bibliographies)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note before diving into the numbers of this notebook. First, I delete titles that are dated 17--, a total of 5 titles). Secondly, the `pubdate_short` column is drawn from the first four characters of the `pubdate` column, meaning that works with a date range, such as 1727 \"buck's antiquities or venerable remains\" by Samuel Buck, published 1727-1740 according to Cox, is reduced to 1727. For many multi-volume titles---especially anthologies such as John Senex's *Modern Geography*, which can be published over several years or even decades---this decision creates a necessary distortion of the publication numbers for 214 titles.\n",

For example, some of the sources have a similar focus (such as women authors), and some sources relied on the others (BTW_W includes Leask, Cox, McVeagh, and Robinson_W, for example, or, more notably, BrynMawr serving as the foundation for NCCO_c19Trav).\n",
