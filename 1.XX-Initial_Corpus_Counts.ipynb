    "4. I need a naming structure for my charts/images. Mix of chapter/sections and Fig ids?\n",

    "Following the iterative process of cleaning my data, my bibliography consisted of 4970 short titles (with multivolume works combined into one entry), along with their author and year of publication. Even without matching these titles to digital files, this dataset offers an opportunity to explore the metadata of travel writing, ranging from publication dates to cross-references. Because of the boundaries of my project goals and my resources, the findings presented below are only a glimpse of the benefits of this type of bibliographical collation; larger bibliographical projects such as *British Travel Writing*, which also records source cross-references, will offer a more comprehensive view of these networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deep examination of my sources is also a critical step en route to digital corpus formation. The constitution of this foundational corpus influences what digital titles we may find and the distribution of publication dates. Lacking a comprehensive equivalent to Cox in the nineteenth century, my sources become more disparate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a variety of sources contributed to this data, and influenced the numbers. Before we move into searching for files, understanding the constitution of this foundational corpus is important because it influences what works we may find.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook calculates and visualizes numbers in my original bibliography. This includes:\n",
    "1. Publication numbers sorted by year\n",
    "2. Publication numbers sorted by source bibliography\n",
    "        a. Unique titles (ie, titles that appear only in one bibliography)\n",
    "        b. Common titles (ie, titles that appear in more bibliographies)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note before diving into the numbers of this notebook. First, I delete titles that are dated 17--, a total of 5 titles). Secondly, the `pubdate_short` column is drawn from the first four characters of the `pubdate` column, meaning that works with a date range, such as 1727 \"buck's antiquities or venerable remains\" by Samuel Buck, published 1727-1740 according to Cox, is reduced to 1727. For many multi-volume titles---especially anthologies such as John Senex's *Modern Geography*, which can be published over several years or even decades---this decision creates a necessary distortion of the publication numbers for 214 titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also take this opportunity to remind my readers (what am I, a game-show host?! ~change~ ) that not all of the titles are accurately recorded as first editions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's jump in and look at some of the numbers, and try come up with some of my analysis as I do so."

    "Cox clearly dominates; of the 4965 titles in the `origbib` corpus, 4247 of them---85.5%---are in Cox. The next closest source, BrynMawr, is only at 198. The BTW_EuroTour is particularly interesting, as it contains 172 titles, but has a very limited scope: it focuses on travel between 1814-1818, excluding Britain and Ireland. If BTW_EuroTour's total is at all predictive of  publication numbers, then we might expect at least 1290 titles published from the end of 1800 to the end of 1830, rather than the 660 currently in my bibliography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Murray's impact on the publication of travel writing is clear as well; this single publishing house, which includes only 'Non-European' travel texts, contributes more titles than McVeagh's catalogue of Irish travels, or Gove's list of imaginary travels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anthologies and critical works---such as BDanth, Leask, Andrews, and TEE---have less titles in general, as we might expect from works who do not aim at the cataloguing function of bibliographies. The unique cases of the NCCO collection are commented on earlier. *keep this comment?*"

    "Going from 25 titles with four cross-references to 6 titles with five cross-references, the average year of publication stays the same. For a moment, there is a rare gender parity in the corpus: Hester Lynch Piozzi's *Observations and reflections made...through France, Italy, and Germany* (1789), Mary Wollstonecraft's *Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark* (1796), and Anne Carter's *Letters from a Lady to Her Sister, During a Tour to Paris* (1814) are all bolstered by cross-references in women-focused bibliographies, including Robinson_W and BTW_W. Wollstonecraft and  Piozzi are also well-known eighteenth-century figures involved in the world of letters, bolstering, perhaps, their reputation. The titles by men include Mungo Park's famous *Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa* (1799), Edward Daniel Clarke's collection of *Travels in Various Countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa* (1810; NCCO lists a later, 1816 edition), and James Hingston Tuckey's *Narrative of an expedition to explore the river Zaire* (1818).\n",

    "Why might this title be the most cross-referenced? The publication date of *A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794* is covered by the bulk of my sources, increasing the chance of her inclusion. Radcliffe's novels, such as *The Mysteries of Udolpho* (1794) and *The Italian* (1797) were extremely popular during her lifetime, and critics situate her as one of the most important influences on the Gothic novel. Indeed, Radcliffe's popularity comes at a confluence of social factors influencing expectations for women's participation in travel and publishing; as Elizabeth Bohls traces in her discussion of Ann Radcliffe's *The Mysteries of Udolpho*, \"Both tourism and writing for publication took women into the public realm in potentially transgressive ways. Sensibility and taste helped legitimize a woman like Radcliffe in her pursuit of these dubious endeavors” (103). Four extracts from *A Journey* were published in the *Lady's Magazine* (three in 1795 and one in 1797). Radcliffe's publisher for *Udolpho* and *A Journey*, the radical George Robinson, was best known for his travel narratives, translations, and periodicals, \"position[ing] Radcliffe and her work outside of the insular worlds of the British novel and the fashionable milieu of the circulating library, and makes her a significant part of early conversations about human rights and even what we might today call global citizenship\" (287).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the significance of Radcliffe's ouvre in discussions of landscape aesthetics (note her presence in `Andrews`), the picturesque, and the Gothic, as well as the availability of accessible scholarly editions of most of her novels (Oxford has published editions of *Udolpho*, *A Sicilian Romance*, *The Romance of the Forest*, and *The Italian*, for example), it is regrettable that there is not an easily accessible edition of *A Journey*.\n",
